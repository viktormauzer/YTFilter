# YTFilter

A practice project for my [iOS Portfolio website](https://viktormauzer.github.io) built using SwiftUI where the app filters content in a list based on a button press similar to the YouTube app on iOS (only the content is in image form, not video). 

## Installation

Clone repo and run in Xcode

## Details

All categories are added to the selector automatically based on the included data. By tapping on each category, the list shows coresponding data. The names of the artists who took the photos are shown as "Uploaded by" and other data (views and dates) are from Unsplash where the artists uploaded the photos.
